Dave Collins is an offensive security professional, husband, and dad. In his free time he enjoys spending time with his family and playing pen and paper role playing games like D&D and Shadowrun. He also enjoys hacking together code with Ruby. This site was built so he could learn about static HTML sites and Jekyll during a break between jobs.
